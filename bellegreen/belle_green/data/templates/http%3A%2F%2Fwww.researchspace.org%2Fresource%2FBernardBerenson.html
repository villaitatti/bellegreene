						 Bernard Berenson
					</h1>
					<p>
						 Bernard Berenson (1865-1959) was one of the most famous and influential connoisseurs of Italian Renaissance paintings and drawings. Beginning in the 1890s, his many publications established his reputation as the leading expert on Italian drawings and paintings of the 14th and 15th centuries, and would define the field for generations of students and scholars to come. His critical eye and in-depth knowledge of the visual arts made his expertise in authenticating paintings much sought after, and he worked as a consultant and intermediary with important art dealers, among them the Duveen brothers in England, and with wealthy American collectors building major Renaissance collections of art, such as Isabella Stewart Gardner in Boston, John G. Johnson and Peter A. B. Widener in Philadelphia, and Henry Walters in Baltimore.

																					 <p>Berenson was born Bernhard Valvrojenski in Lithuania to Albert (originally Alter) Valvrojenski and Judith (originally Eudice) Mickleshanski (Valvrojenski). After moving&nbsp; the family to Boston in 1875, his father changed their surname to Berenson. Bernard maintained the original spelling of his first name until 1914. Later, he was often known by his initials, BB (or&nbsp;<em>Bibi</em>&nbsp;in Italian).&nbsp;He attended the Boston Latin School from 1881, and in 1883 enrolled at Boston University, transferring to Harvard in 1884 where he graduated in 1887. At Harvard, Berenson majored in literature and studied languages, not only Greek and Latin but Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Arabic, as well, and also took courses in other humanistic disciplines, including art history.</p>

																					 <p>Friends and patrons Berenson met during his formative university years in Boston and Cambridge provided crucial financial support for his post-graduate travels in Europe, where his interests gradually turned from literature to the visual arts. Within a few years he was moving in circles of influential collectors and art historians, published his first studies on art, and purchased his first works of art as an intermediary for collector friends. In England in 1888 he met Mary Smith Costello (1864-1945), a married woman from a Philadelphia Quaker family, who the following year left her husband and two children to follow the charismatic young Berenson to Italy to study art. They would marry in 1900 after the death of her first husband.&nbsp; Mary, who became an accomplished art historian in her own right, would be an indispensable partner in Bernard’s scholarly and business success.</p>

																					 <p>In 1894 Berenson published <em>The Venetian Painters of the Renaissance</em>, a collaborative work with Mary, which enjoyed immediate success. It was the first in a series of four studies on the major Italian schools, or painting styles, of the period as characterized by Berenson: <em>Florentine Painters</em> appeared in 1896, followed by <em>Central Italian Painters</em> in 1897, and finally <em>Northern Italian Painters</em> in 1907, all later reissued collectively as <em>The Italian Painters of the Renaissance</em>, or <em>Italian Pictures of the Renaissance.</em> This quartet of studies, often revised and republished, won a wide readership and securely established Berenson’s fame; they quickly became the foundational texts for the nascent courses in the history of art being developed in universities throughout America and beyond. In 1903 he published his most important and substantial work of scholarship, <em>The Drawings of the Florentine Painters</em>, still considered an indispensable resource.&nbsp; Other major art historical works by Berenson include <em>The Study and Criticism of Italian Art</em> (1901-1916), <em>Venetian Paintings in America</em> (1916), <em>Essays in the Study of Sienese Painting</em> (1918), and <em>Studies in Medieval Painting</em> (1930).</p>

																					 <p>In 1907, with his fame secured and his financial future promising thanks to the success of his publications and his growing income as expert consultant to art dealers and collectors, he and Mary purchased the villa outside Florence known as “I Tatti,” where they had been living as renters since soon after their marriage in 1900. There, after extensive renovations and expansions, they would live for the rest of their lives, developing a landmark garden, a noteworthy collection of paintings and other art objects, and a remarkable library.</p>
