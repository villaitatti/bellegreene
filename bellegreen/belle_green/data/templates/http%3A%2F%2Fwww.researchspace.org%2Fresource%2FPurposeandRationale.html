                                        <p>Any project that aims to present or publish Belle Greene’s letters to Bernard Berenson faces an ethical dilemma. Belle Greene destroyed the letters Berenson sent her and apparently wanted him to destroy the letters she wrote him. Berenson, however, preserved them. What business do we have, then, in broadcasting their content to the world?</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-000ec86f gb-headline-text">Rationale</h3>
                                        <p>To promote access to primary sources related to Belle Greene, primary sources heavily in demand from scholars and readers with a range of interests, the Morgan Library &amp; Museum staff in charge of both this project and the Morgan’s 2024 exhibition on Belle Greene have decided to digitize, transcribe, and publish online her letters to Berenson in full. But that decision was not made lightly and much thought and care has been put into the presentation of these letters to a public audience. This page discusses some of the complexity surrounding the destruction of Greene’s papers and the decision to publish or not publish her letters.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-e17a8ec8 gb-headline-text">Destroying Berenson’s Letters</h3>
                                        <p>Several friends of Greene attest that before her death in 1950, she destroyed her incoming correspondence from Berenson, “those precious letters that had contributed so largely to her education” in the words of her friend Rose Nichols Standish. That she destroyed additional personal papers is evident by the fact that there are no papers, diaries, or letters listed in the inventory of her estate. The received wisdom regarding this situation is that Greene then asked Berenson to destroy her letters to him. His refusal to fulfill this request prompted a famous observation about Berenson, that in burning his letters “she had destroyed his autobiography … but he could not bring himself to destroy hers.”</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-869ae27f gb-headline-text">Preserving Greene’s Letters</h3>
                                        <p>The fact of the matter is that we only have Berenson’s word that Greene made this request to destroy her letters, for she never asks him to do this in the letters she wrote him near the end of her life. In early 1952 Fred Adams, the new Director of the Pierpont Morgan Library, wrote Berenson to thank him for sending a book with a dedication to Belle Greene, adding that “it was nice to find among her books several that you had presented to her forty-odd years ago. I hope you have preserved her letters.” In the early 1950s the Morgan carefully sorted through the artwork, books, and manuscripts left to the institution as a gift of Belle Greene’s estate. Trustees’ minutes describe a slow and deliberate process through which certain objects were accessioned, some auctioned, some sold, and others donated to friends and colleagues. This context is crucial for understanding Adams’s point about Berenson preserving Greene’s letters. Rather than “urging” Berenson to preserve them despite Greene’s wishes, as suggested by Heidi Ardizzone’s 2007 biography of Greene, it seems instead that Adams was simply thinking about the greater legacy of Greene and making connections between the books in her library and the thousands of words she wrote to Berenson. It doesn’t seem that Fred Adams was ever in doubt that Berenson would preserve her letters.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-92b78311 gb-headline-text">Belle Greene’s Lost Diary</h3>
                                        <p>Greene’s correspondence with Berenson also offers evidence that she created additional forms of life-writing, namely a multi-volume diary that no longer survives today. She first describes it to Berenson in a letter from September 1909:&nbsp;</p>
                                        <p><em>“Did I tell you that for the first time in my life I am keeping a diary? It is the greatest relief to find a dear white sheet before you that you know will be silent as the grave &amp; then to tell it unreservedly all one thinks. I write down everything I see or hear during the day, all my personal impressions &amp; feelings and have been surprised at the number and variety of events it records for me – I shall never allow a living soul to see it &amp; for that reason I write things I hardly dare think.”</em></p>
                                        <p>The passage offers a fascinating glimpse at highly personal life-writing of Belle Greene’s, writing that she would have never shown to Berenson,&nbsp; most certainly relegated to the flames before her death. We have no way of accessing what Greene may have written in this diary. Did she perhaps comment on her family background, her feelings on passing as White, and/or her emotions concerning her father? Though it is tantalizing to think she did express such thoughts, we can never know for sure and that archival gap is intentional. What the existence of this diary does indicate, however, is that Greene’s letters to Berenson were not as private and personal as other documents she created. There are, in other words, various gradations of privacy in the written work Greene produced—some of it was available to Berenson, some of it was not.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-715e1e59 gb-headline-text">References to Race&nbsp;</h3>
                                        <p>Belle Greene never directly addresses her feelings about passing or her father in the letters she wrote to Berenson, for instance, only referring to race and her own racial identity in suggestive and oblique ways. As Jean Strouse writes in <em>Morgan: American Financier</em>, “Whatever Belle did tell Berenson about her background, her letters to him made constant, deeply conflicted reference to blackness and her physical appearance—reflecting a painful consciousness of a world that defined beauty in features that were not her own.” While “constant” is perhaps an overstatement (there are about twenty such references in 600+ letters), Strouse’s point about Greene’s “deeply conflicted” allusions to race are spot on.</p>
                                        <p>Rather than hide these allusions, only making them accessible to readers who can travel to Italy or decipher Greene’s handwriting, we feel it is important to make them widely available and to encourage dialogue around them. One does not get the sense that Greene’s letters to Berenson contain “secrets” about her life, for she never divulges her true parentage and racial background in her correspondence. As Strouse and Ardizzone suggest, Belle may have discussed the subject in-person when she saw Bernard in New York or Italy, but she did commit these thoughts to paper. Passing was a topic that passing individuals, for obvious reasons, did not write down.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-991fcdd2 gb-headline-text">Greene Comments on Her Correspondence: Publish</h3>
                                        <p>We also have Greene’s own words about her correspondence with Berenson. Going back to this essay’s opening epigraph, Greene seems, in 1911, completely indifferent to the possibility of the wider publication of their letters: “what does it matter if some one at some time, any time should see my letters to you or yours to me – The whole world may know how I feel about you as far as I am concerned – I am so proud and happy to love you.”</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-839898b5 gb-headline-text">Greene Comments on Her Correspondence: Don’t Publish&nbsp;</h3>
                                        <p>What Greene felt in 1911, however, does not necessarily apply to other phases of her life, or even to her thoughts a couple weeks later. After twelve days she wrote another letter in which she seems less sure of strangers reading their correspondence: “I wonder if you have the slightest idea of what fascinating letters you write – I shall guard them mighty carefully for if anyone ever got hold of them they most surely would publish them – Imagine our divine letters read by any old non-understanding person.”</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-2853ee8a gb-headline-text">Greene Comments on Her Correspondence: Redact&nbsp;</h3>
                                        <p>Later that year, in the summer, Belle again commented on her love for Bernard’s letters: “ [I] simply could not exist without you, your love and your letters – and what letters they are – I’m surely going to publish them some day – with plentiful asterisks!!!” These three comments, all written in the same year, each offer conflicting approaches to publishing Greene’s letters: publish them, don’t publish them, or publish them with redactions. Put another way, Greene’s own words do not offer clear guidance on how a modern editor should proceed.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-1da842d2 gb-headline-text">Using the Letters to Write Greene’s Biography</h3>
                                        <p>The only biography of Belle da Costa Greene, Heidi Ardizzone’s <em>An Illuminated Life</em>, makes extensive use of the Greene–Berenson correspondence. It is in fact the chief source for the book, underscoring the importance of these letters for reconstructing the details of Greene’s life. But Ardizzone was not the first writer to consider using the letters in a biographical project.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-03b684ab gb-headline-text">Anne Lyon Haight (1891–1977)</h3>
                                        <p>The first was Anne Lyon Haight, a rare book collector, writer, and founding member of the Hroswitha Club, a bibliophilic society for women that operated from 1944 to 2004 in New York City. Haight was friends with Belle Greene, who was elected as an Honorary Member of the Hroswitha Club and hosted its members for a behind-the-scenes tour of the Pierpont Morgan Library’s vaults in 1948. Letters between Haight and Greene do not survive, but correspondence between one of Greene’s proteges at the Morgan—the medieval manuscript specialist Meta Harrsen—and Bernard Berenson help document their relationship. According to Harrsen, writing a few months after Greene’s death, Haight was “one of Belle’s staunchest friends,” remarking that “Anne is one of the small select company that remained watchfull [sic] and true through the dark times, overlooking insults, and remembering all the fine things and happy times she owed Belle.” She was particularly close with Greene in her final days: “Mrs. Haight has been simply wonderful in her devoted friendship, taking care of the many details that normally would be done by a member of the family, none of whom has volunteered to be of the slightest help.”</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-842c608c gb-headline-text">Haight’s Planned Biography</h3>
                                        <p>Because of this intimacy and her shared interest in rare books and manuscripts, Anne soon embarked on a project to write a biography of her friend. As Harrsen described to Berenson, “Anne realizes the need of getting an accurate chronological sequence; there is so much conjecture and fantastic rumor that it will be well to have a responsible person set down the facts.” The biography bore the working title “The Training of a Librarian.”</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-2abdef93 gb-headline-text">Research Materials for a Life of Greene</h3>
                                        <p>A recently discovered file in the Archives of the Morgan Library &amp; Museum reveals that Haight owned letters Belle Greene had exchanged with the scholars Arthur Hind and Sydney Cockerell, as well as her nephew (and ward) Robert “Bobbie” Mackenzie Leveridge. (Only the Cockerell letters have been known, and they have been missing from the Morgan since the mid-1990s.) Other letters in the same file provide details of Anne Haight’s efforts to read and analyze the Greene–Berenson correspondence at I Tatti, a portion of which she photocopied. The file was compiled by the Morgan’s former director Charles Ryskamp in the early 1970s, clearly in an effort to collect memories and stories about Greene from people who knew her, perhaps to commemorate the 25th anniversary of her death in 1975. It contains revealing letters from Anne Haight, Meta Harrsen, and Jane Norton (Morgan) Nichols—Jack Morgan’s daughter and interim President of the Board of Trustees of the Pierpont Morgan Library.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-1d5ec3ec gb-headline-text">Resistance to Haight’s Biography</h3>
                                        <p>One of the most revealing aspects of this correspondence is the palpable anxiety around Anne Haight’s biographical project. Though she would co-write (with Greene’s protege Dorothy Miner) a short biography of Greene for <em>Notable American Women</em> in 1971, her proposed full-length biography of Greene never materialized, partially due to health issues. It also seems that she faced some opposition from friends of Greene, including Rose Nichols Standish and Berenson himself, as well as criticism from Meta Harrsen, Jane Nichols, and Charles Ryskamp. The typescript draft of Haight’s Greene biography does not survive, but clearly all three of these correspondents read and commented on it, as alluded to in the Morgan Library file. Each agreed that the biography should focus on Greene’s achievements as a librarian and art historian rather than her “emotional life,” with quotes from the Sydney Cockerell correspondence being preferable to Berenson’s. Meta Harrsen, writing in 1968, expresses concern over Haight publishing letters to Berenson that express Greene’s negative opinions of the Morgan family, including Pierpont, his son-in-law Herbert Satterlee, and his daughter Anne Morgan. She thought it was too soon to publish such content, when “so many fine members of the family are alive.” (It seems possible that Anne Haight was planning to publish some of these letters in their entirety, but whether as a stand-alone volume or incorporated into her planned biography is unclear.) Anne Haight agrees with these criticisms, and even goes so far as to call herself a traitor to Belle if she were to proceed with full publication of the letters to Berenson.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-b6e82f8b gb-headline-text">Haight’s Biography in Retrospect</h3>
                                        <p>Looking back on this history from the vantage point of 2023, nearly seventy-five years after Greene’s death and sixteen years since Ardizzone’s <em>An Illuminated Life</em>, it is clear that her friends, colleagues, and successors cared very deeply about her legacy and wished to preserve it against slander and misconception. The close relationship of these figures with the Pierpont Morgan Library—as a family member and Board President, Director, and former Keeper of Manuscripts—meant they were trying to protect themselves and the institution itself as much as the memory of Belle Greene. Ardizzone’s book published many revealing and unflattering passages from Greene’s correspondence with Berenson, the very content that would have embarrassed Anne Haight, Charles Ryskamp, Jane Nichols, and Meta Harrsen in the 1960s and 70s. The cat is out of the bag, so to speak, and the semi-private thoughts of Belle Greene have now been subject to the scrutiny of readers for over a dozen years.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-a484ee5b gb-headline-text">“Personal” and “Professional” Correspondence</h3>
                                        <p>Traditionally Greene’s letters to Berenson have been labeled “personal” and her business letters in the Morgan Archives regarded as “professional.” There is certainly much overlap in the Morgan Archives between early institutional records and the professional papers of Belle Greene, but those papers also contain letters that might be regarded as “personal” in content and tone. In fact, Greene struck up friendships with many of the people she met through her job at the Morgan Library. Her correspondence with people like Father Henri Hyvernat, E.H. Dring of the bookselling firm Quaritch, and William Ivins Jr. of the Metropolitan Museum of Art—though exchanged under professional auspices—are some of Greene’s most personal, witty, and revealing letters.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-1b076bf5 gb-headline-text">Love Letters?</h3>
                                        <p>There is a danger of mischaracterizing the Greene–Berenson correspondence by using the label “love letters” to describe them. No doubt the letters contain a considerable amount of romantic sentiment, particularly in the early years of Greene and Berenson’s relationship. Belle used many endearing epithets when addressing Bernard, including “Egoist,” “beloved of my dreams,” “man so far away,” “Beloved that I want you to be,” “faithless one,” and “you Blessed Lamb of God.” From the letters it is abundantly clear that she is devoted to Bernard, and he to her, and she expresses her love for him deep into their correspondence, long after the romance cooled over the years. This was largely a long-distance relationship and the letters are not sexually explicit; in fact they seem tame not only by modern standards but also compared to the love letters of Greene’s contemporaries.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-4f458de0 gb-headline-text">Intellectual Peers</h3>
                                        <p>Perhaps more than romantic lovers, Greene and Berenson are best described as intellectual peers. From the very start of their friendship in the spring of 1909, Belle and Bernard spoke of scholarly matters and projects. Belle wrote him about her professional ambitions and struggles at the Morgan Library, and she was keen to hear his thoughts on works of art and literature. Berenson wrote her with requests for books and manuscripts, or to request her help in acquiring works for his private collection. He was also happy to review her translations of Italian poetry and other writings, and he often passed on her work to mutual friends, including Ralph Adams Cram. Their relationship was characterized by intellectual collaboration and mutual admiration.&nbsp;</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-f4b40f84 gb-headline-text">Personal/Professional</h3>
                                        <p>In other words, efforts to separate the “personal” from the “professional” in the extant correspondence of Belle Greene is a difficult enterprise, for these categories are entangled and mutually constitutive. That is not to say, of course, that in her letters to Berenson Greene said only professional things. It is well known that she did not always have flattering words about members of the Morgan family, including her bosses. The true complexity of her relationship with Pierpont comes out in her letters, in both the deep respect and admiration she held for him as well as the anger and tension that sometimes characterized their exchanges.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-ac0a6c7e gb-headline-text">The Corpus of Greene’s Correspondence</h3>
                                        <p>The fullest picture of Greene’s activities emerges from a broad consideration of her letters to Berenson (and other friends) together with the business letters she wrote to cultural institutions and colleagues. The contents of letters from these different groups often flesh out and amplify one another, and sources from each group must be marshaled to build narratives about her life and career.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-fd6a5d09 gb-headline-text">Promoting Access</h3>
                                        <p>What is abundantly clear, however, is that there is high demand to read Belle Greene’s letters to Berenson. This interest among scholars and the general public was no doubt galvanized by the publication of Heidi Ardizzone’s <em>An Illuminated Life</em> in 2007. But there has also been a surge of interest following the publication of two works of historical fiction about Greene: Alexandra LaPierre’s <em>Belle Greene</em> and Victoria Benedict and Victoria Christopher Murray’s <em>The Personal Librarian</em>, the latter of which has become a book club favorite in the United States.</p>
                                        <h3 class="gb-headline gb-headline-24764f38 gb-headline-text">Context for the Letters</h3>
                                        <p>Historically there have been some barriers to accessing the content of this correspondence, in that the letters are written in difficult-to-learn handwriting and reading them requires extensive travel leave for research in Italy. Digitizing the letters, but also providing contextual material and ancillary texts like transcriptions, handwriting guides, and letter-specific metadata, provides researchers with unprecedented access to the Greene–Berenson correspondence. Rather than simply digitizing the letters and putting them into a large Digital Library setting without proper context, we decided it was essential to build a website around them and offer a basic amount of interpretive scaffolding for users.</p>

                                        <p>In the spirit of promoting access to the surviving primary sources about Belle Greene, and given the long span of time that has elapsed since she died (73 years at the time of writing), we feel that by carefully presenting this trove of Greene’s words—this font of her “life-enhancing” (as she might have put it) voice—this website will serve to deepen our understanding of her life while promoting knowledge about her career and legacy.

These letters, so crucial for so much of what we know about Greene, are themselves implicated in these tensions and narrative negotiations.</p>
