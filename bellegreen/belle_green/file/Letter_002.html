  Tuxedo – Easter Sunday
  Sir – I embrace you! –
  This is a most glorious Easter day – radiant with sunshine and the world – like myself is bubbling over with joy – This is one of the days which proves 
  that I am a pagan
</p>
<p align="left">
  pure and simple –
  We had a most glorious horseback ride this afternoon – were out for over two hours – and if you have ever been here you know what a glorious country it is for riding –
  Last night we had a real old fashioned barn-
<p align="left">
  dance at the Higgins’ which was lots of fun – and tomorrow we are going off on a motor picnic. I know all this sounds very giddy and foolish to you oh! wise and learned Man – 
  but the Spring has gotten in to my blood and
<p align="left">
  I am lost to all but reckless gayety. I feel as if I were the re-incarnation of the original bacchante and want nothing in the world but to laugh + sing and dance + be spoiled – You know 
  I dearly love to be petted and spoiled – It is my
<p align="left">
  greatest weakness – and I suppose I really ought to try – (at least) to overcome it – but I don’t –
  What silly rot I am writing you – but you remember that I warned you, if I wrote you as often as you wished that you would have
<p align="left">
  to stand all my different moods – and they are many and boreing [sic] I assure you –
  I am dismayed at the thought of not hearing from you for a week – It’s absurd and cruel you heartless man – 
  Why are you not here beloved to kiss me and
<p align="left">
  pet me [double underlined: and] correct my English? – I would be perfectly willing to exchange all the men of this houseparty for you – and there are some exceptionally nice ones in the lot – 
  but you, my dear, never bore one,
<p align="left">
  which is the most extravagant praise I can give you –
  What fun it would be to have you here – to go out into the woods – with all their promise of blooms with all their fresh colours washed by the dew before the dawn – to talk when we pleased to walk 
  when we pleased – sit down
<p align="left">
  when we pleased – then “loaf on up the hill” – Nature has me in her bonds today and holds me with a grip of steel from which I have no desire to break away – I went out early this morning before any 
  one was down – and was all alone with the
<p align="left">
  the [sic] sunlight and a little stream of sparkling water that runs through the grounds, it was a curious feeling! a sense of something [double underlined: more]. the water was more to one than water
   and the sun – than mere sun – the gleaming rays onf the water in my hand held me for a moment, the touch of the water gave me something from itself. A moment, the
<p align="left">
  gleam was gone, the water flowing away – but I had had them. I had received from them their beauty they had given me of their silent mystery – and I thought of you – dear – of the fleeting hours I
   had spent with you – and they too like the water + sunshine had flown
<p align="left">
  away – but the beauty and mystery of them remain and in my thoughts are multiplied a thousandfold 
  How wonderful that you wish to give me so much of yourself! From the littleness and meanness and pettinesses forced upon me by circumstances and other people – what a relief and joy to turn to the
   abundance of your love – you do not know how 
<p align="left">
  much it means to me – and I can’t tell you – I thought of it a long time this morning when I was out all alone in the beautiful God-made world – I lay down in the grass and looked up at the sky, – 
  gazing for a long time till I could see deep into the azure and my eyes were full of the color + then I turned my face to the 
<p align="left">
  grass, placing my hands at each side of my face to shut out every thing and hide myself. I had drunk deeply of the heaven above and the earth beneath and for a time was absorbed into the being or 
  existence of the universe – then I thought of you – my soul-companion – and all sense of space and separateness was lost – and you were there – a part of the whole
<p align="left">
  and then I whispered to you and you whispered to me – oh lots of real secrets, beloved – and the sun hung over the vale as if it had been put there by hand, and glowed on the sward, burning burning 
  even as your words burned into me – oh! my dear how many, many years, how many cycles of years, how many bundles of cycles of years are to pass before we rush into each other’s arms?
<p align="left">
  My dear, they have come to announce dinner and I have not [double underlined: begun] to dress!! – I had kept no track of the time but as my dear Browning says “there is no clock for feeling, for 
  joy, for love” – I would that I could spread abroad my arms and gather you to me Beloved – I want more ideas of soul life – I am certain there are more and you can give them to me – I kiss your eyes – Belle
